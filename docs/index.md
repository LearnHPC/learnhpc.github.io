# Welcome to LearnHPC!

## What is this website for?

The goal of this website is to ensure that High Performance Computing (HPC) is an
accessible technology for the widest possible community of scientific researchers. We
wish to act
as a gateway to materials, resources and tools that will lower or remove as many
barriers as
possible in the learners journey when discovering High Performance Computing (HPC).

We want to formulate a scalable HPC training
approach that will facilitate the removal of any perception of elitism from HPC
and expose the maximum amount of
researchers possible to HPC resources, and the possibilities that they can enable. For
those that continue beyond the introductory material you will find here, we will try
to point you to the next level of HPC resources (and associated training).

### Intended audience

The target audience for the final page is *anyone* who is motivated to learn more about
HPC. Contributors to this page are likely to be people who are trying to cater to that
audience.

We are (mostly) linking to external content, so we try to keep the contextual information
pretty brief, and the details you can find through the links.

There are likely many biases in the way we present things here (and content we include),
which reflect the activities and interests of the people who have contributed them.
Hopefully these biases help more than they hurt!
